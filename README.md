<h1>Employee - Management System</h1>

A Java console-based CRUD application for managing employee records, built using Object-Oriented Programming and modular class design. The system leverages data structures such as HashMap/ArrayList for efficient storage and retrieval, implements input validation and exception handling for robustness, and follows clean separation of concerns between models, managers, and UI logic.

### FEATURES
<li>
  <ul>Add new employees with structured details (name, surname, ID, salary, etc.)</ul>
  <ul>View and list all stored employees</ul>
  <ul>Update existing employees records by key/ID</ul>
  <ul>Delete employees safely from system</ul>
  <ul>Fast data lookup using HashMap</ul>
  <ul>input validation and exception handling to prevent crahes</ul>
  <ul>Menu-driven console inteface for smooth interaction</ul>
</li>


### Architecture

The System follows a modular, object-Oriented design with clear seperation of responsibilities:

<li>
  <ol><b>Model Layer</b>
  - Employee class respresenting employee data and attributes</ol>
  <ol><b>Manager/Service Layer
  -employeeManager handles business logic and CRUD operations</b></ol>
  <ol><b>UI Layer
  - main class managers user interaction and menu flow</b></ol>
  <ol><b>Collections Layer
  - In-memeory storage using Java collections for efficient access and manipulation</b></ol>

  This structure improves maintainability, scalability, and code readability.
