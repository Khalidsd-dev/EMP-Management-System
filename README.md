# Employee Management System

A Java console-based CRUD application for managing employee records, built using Object-Oriented Programming and a modular class design. The system leverages data structures such as **HashMap** and **ArrayList** for efficient storage and retrieval, implements input validation and exception handling for reliability, and maintains clear separation of concerns between models, services, and UI logic.

---

## Features
- Add new employees with structured details (name, surname, ID, salary, etc.)
- View and list all stored employees
- Update existing employee records by key/ID
- Delete employees safely from the system
- Fast data lookup using HashMap / ArrayList
- Input validation and exception handling to prevent crashes
- Menu-driven console interface for smooth interaction

---

## Architecture

The system follows a modular, Object-Oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities:

1. **Model Layer** – `Employee` class representing employee data and attributes  
2. **Manager/Service Layer** – `EmployeeManager` handles business logic and CRUD operations  
3. **UI Layer** – `Main` class manages user interaction and menu flow  
4. **Collections Layer** – In-memory storage using Java collections for efficient access and manipulation  

This structure improves maintainability, scalability, and readability.
