Employee Management System

A Java console-based CRUD application for managing employee records, built using Object-Oriented Programming and a modular class design. The system leverages data structures such as HashMap and ArrayList for efficient storage and retrieval, implements input validation and exception handling for reliability, and maintains clear separation of concerns between models, services, and UI logic.

⚙️ Features

Add new employees with structured details (name, surname, ID, salary, etc.)

View and list all stored employees

Update existing employee records by key/ID

Delete employees safely from the system

Fast data lookup using HashMap / ArrayList

Input validation and exception handling to prevent crashes

Menu-driven console interface for smooth interaction

🧠 Architecture

The system follows a modular, Object-Oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities:

Model Layer – Employee class representing employee data and attributes

Manager/Service Layer – EmployeeManager handles business logic and CRUD operations

UI Layer – Main class manages user interaction and menu flow

Collections Layer – In-memory storage using Java collections for efficient access and manipulation

This structure improves maintainability, scalability, and readability.
